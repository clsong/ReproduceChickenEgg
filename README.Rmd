The goal of this package is to reproduce the paper "Generalism drives abundance: a computational causal discovery approach" by Chuliang Song, Benno I. Simmons, Marie-Jos√©e Fortin, and Andrew Gonzalez.

## Installation

You can install the package from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("clsong/ReproduceChickenEgg")
```

## Reproduce
The main figures can be reproduced simply by running *plot_figure_Number*. For example, figure S9 can be reproduced as
```{r dpi=300, warning=F, message=F}
library(ReproduceChickenEgg)
plot_figure_S9()
```
